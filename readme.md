Just started learning Phyton This is my project that's created when I learning Python from scratch or coding in particular.. I choose Python because it's popular and used widely, I considered learning Java or javascript first but I have to learn CSS / HTTP which make me confused This projects were created with material from this site: https://thehelloworldprogram.com/python/

#14 was from Python Discord community by @Shirayuki-himesama
